{"name":"Mold","tagline":"Form validation for Seaside","body":"### Welcome to Mold\r\n\r\n[Mold as taken from Squeaksource](http://kentreis.wordpress.com/2008/08/27/mold-form-validation-for-seaside/)\r\n\r\nMold is a project to implement a sort of \"form helper\" for Seaside. Forms can be boring to build and validate, and Mold makes this task easier. Mold makes no requirements of your components or your model objects. It doesn't use any metadata; it allows you to choose how you want each form rendered; and it doesn't require you to use it to build the entire form. It's just a helper, and it gets out of your way when you don't need it.\r\n\r\nThe goal is to make a version that will work with Twitter Bootstrap.\r\n\r\nCompared to the original code, everything is prefixed with Mold in order to avoid name clashes.\r\n\r\n    Gofer it\r\n            smalltalkhubUser: 'philippeback' project: 'Mold';\r\n            load.\r\n\r\nPoint your browser to: http://localhost:8088/examples/mold\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nMold was originally written by Ken Treis.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
